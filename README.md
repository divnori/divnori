### Hi there! My name is Divya.

I am a Computer Science student at MIT interested in novel applications of AI/ML for drug discovery and disease diagnosis. Currently, with the Uhler Group @ Broad Institute and Coley Group @ MIT CS, I am working on:

* Generative modeling for de novo drug design
* Deep learning for receptor-ligand binding prediction
* Kernel methods for cheminformatics applications

Previously, my highlights include:

* Won grand awards at the International Science and Engineering Fair for AI-based tools for drug overdose detection and behavioral health applications
* Interned at Eli Lilly on the Bioproducts R&D team
* Conducted computational biology research at the Summer Scholars Research Program at Winship Cancer Institute (Summer 2021), Summer Science Program in Biochemistry at Purdue University (Summer 2020), and Georgia Governor's Honors Program in Biology at Berry College (Summer 2019)

**Skills:** Python, Java, C/C++, Molecular Operating Environment, MATLAB, Arduino

**Packages:** PyTorch, TF-Keras, PyMOL, RDKit, NLTK, other Python data science libraries
