### Hi there! My name is Divya.

I am a Computer Science student at MIT interested in novel applications of AI/ML for drug discovery and disease diagnosis. Currently, with the Uhler Group @ Broad Institute and Coley Group @ MIT CS, I am working on:

* Generative modeling for de novo drug design
* Deep learning for receptor-ligand binding prediction
* Kernel methods for cheminformatics applications

**Skills:** Python, Java, C/C++, Molecular Operating Environment, MATLAB, Arduino

**Packages:** PyTorch, TF-Keras, PyMOL, RDKit, NLTK, other Python data science libraries
